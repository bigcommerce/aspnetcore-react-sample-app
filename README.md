# ASP.NET Core React App for BigCommerce

This is a basic BigCommerce app with two screens, a catalog summary view and list of orders that can be cancelled, built using ASP.NET Core and React. It uses BigCommerce's design library, [BigDesign](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/).

It's meant to fast track your ability to take a concept for an app to something usable within the BigCommerce control panel. A live store can install this app while it runs locally.

## Installation

Before jumping in, you'll want to make sure you have the system requirements met:

- C# and ASP.NET Core ([Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-aspnet-core?view=vs-2019))
- Node.js ([Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Local SSL Cert ([Installation Guide](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/developing-locally-with-aspnet-core-under-https-ssl-and-selfsigned-certs))

To test on a BigCommerce store, you can create a free trial on bigcommerce.com or request a free sandbox store by [signing up to be a tech partner](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/).

## Usage

To run the app:

```bash
dotnet run
```

After compiling the app should be reachable at the site you are hosting the app on locally. i.e https://localhost:9457/

### Environment

Set the following environment variables (or add a `.env` file):

```
# Existing env variable. Make sure it matches the base URL of your app
APP_URL=https://localhost:9457

[ ... other existing variables ... ]

# New env variables for BC app and a test API credentials for local dev
# The Client ID and Secret can be found at https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps by selecting 'View Client ID'
BC_APP_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BC_APP_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# These local credentials can be created by creating an API Account within your BigCommerce store (Advanced Settings > API Accounts)
BC_LOCAL_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BC_LOCAL_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BC_LOCAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
BC_LOCAL_STORE_HASH=stores/xxxxxxxxxxx
```

When running the app outside of BigCommerce, setting the follow environment variable will cause the app to use the local API credential (also in the .env file):

```
APP_ENV=local
```

Likewise, setting it to production will use only the credentials received during the OAuth handshake when the app is install on the BigCommerce store:

```
APP_ENV=production
```
